# UserChurnRate
## Description:
This project was used in order to learn how to calculate User Churn Rate from a subscriptions file using SQL commands in a CodeCademy Data Analysis Course

## Accomplishment:
I followed the instructions and was able to build this single SQL code using temporary tables, CASE funciton, WITH and aggregate commands
I ran it and was able to calculate 3 months worth of churn rates from a database avaialble in CodeCademy
